UNDERSTANDING THE CUBE:

  Some things to remember:
  * A Rubik's cube only has one solution!
  * That means every piece has a specific place it needs to be.
  * This means there aren't any duplicate pieces
  * The center pieces never move relative to each other!
  * Corners will always be corners, and edges will always be edges.
  * It isn't so much a "cube of cubes" as much as it is a 3d puzzle with 8 corners and 12 edges
  
 STARTING TO SOLVE:
 
  We're going to build the cube step by step, the same way every time.
  We'll start by completing one side, then slowly fill in the rest of the cube.
  * For consistency, always start with the side that has the WHITE center piece
  * If you ever mess up, go back to whichever step necessary to re-build the cube to where it was
  * The goal is to move pieces to their 'correct' or 'solved' positions

1. THE CROSS

  The first step is to find the white center piece, and put the appropriate white edge pieces next to it.
  This will make what we call a white 'cross'.  It will look like a plus sign!
  
  * Don't just put the edges white-side-up, make sure they're in the correct spots!
  * Example:  There is only one edge that is both white and red, so it needs to go between the white and red center pieces.
  * Red goes opposite orange, and green is opposite blue.  
  * Yellow is opposite white, which means we'll save all the yellow pieces for last!
  * This step is largely intuitive, which means you can figure it out like a puzzle.
  * When all four white edges are in the correct spots, move to step 2!
  
 2. WHITE CORNERS
 
  Now that the cross is complete, we have to fill in the white corners in order to finish this layer.
  Place the white side with the cross facing downwards, and look for where the white corners are.
  Place a white corner above the spot where it needs to go, and look at the algorithms listed
  Based on which way the white sticker is facing, do the appropriate algorithm to place the corner in the correct spot.
  If one of the white corners is already in the bottom layer but oriented incorrectly, perform any of these algorithms to move it out.
  
  * "Where is the correct place for a corner to go?"
  * EXAMPLE: If you were looking at the WHITE/RED/BLUE corner, it would need to go inbetween the white red and blue center pieces.
    So place it on the top layer inbetween the red and blue sides.  Then perform the algorithm necessary.
    
3. SECOND LAYER EDGES

  Now that the first layer is complete, make sure it's aligned so that the edges match up with the center pieces on the second layer.
  Then, we'll insert the second layer edges in order to complete the second layer.
  Locate any edge in the top layer that doesn't have a yellow sticker.
  Orient the edge until its outward facing sticker is touching the matching colored center piece.
  Then, perform the appropriate algorithm to move the edge to its solved position.
  If an edge is already in the second layer, but oriented incorrectly, put any other edge in its location to move it to the top layer.
 
4. ORIENT LAST LAYER EDGES

  Look at the top layer.  If you see four yellow edges facing upwards, you're done with this step.
  Otherwise, you'll have either two or zero yellow edges facing upwards.
